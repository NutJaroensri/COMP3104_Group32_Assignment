The importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle

- Faster Delivery: DevOps helps teams release software more quickly by 
automating tasks and improving teamwork.
- Better Collaboration: It brings developers and operations staff together, making it easier to communicate 
and work towards common goals.
- Higher Quality: With continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), 
software is tested often, leading to fewer bugs and better quality.
- Adaptability: Learning DevOps helps developers stay updated with new tools 
and changes in the tech world.
