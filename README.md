## Overview

Welcome to our group assignment for COMP 3104, where we dive into DevOps practices like Git collaboration, branching strategies, and Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

## Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/NutJaroensri/COMP3104_Group32_Assignment
- Switch to your branch using 'git checkout STUDENTID-Name' ex. git checkout 101422089-NutJaroensri
- Install dependencies needed

## CI/CD Pipeline
We’ve set up GitHub Actions to handle CI for us. Every time you push your code, the pipeline kicks in to run our tests and checks to make sure everything is working smoothly. You can find the CI configuration in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

This way, we can catch any bugs early and keep our project running like a well-oiled machine.

## Branching Workflow

We’re using a simple but effective branching strategy. Each team member has their own branch, named after their Student ID and name, and all the code changes happen there. Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request (PR) to have them reviewed and merged into the main branch.

look like:
- Nut: 101422089-NutJaroensri
- Paradee: 101374958-ParadeeSupapian

## Our Mission
We aim to
- Master git collaboration by working as a team
- implement CI using Github actions to automate test and build
- Follow a smooth and organized branching strategy for our project's development.
